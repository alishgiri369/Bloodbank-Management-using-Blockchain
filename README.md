# Blood Bank Management System Using Blockchain  

## Project Overview  
This repository presents a **Blood Bank Management System** built on blockchain technology to ensure transparency, traceability, and efficiency in blood management. The system tracks the lifecycle of blood, from collection to testing and distribution. Additionally, it enables users to book blood supplies online and ensures the allocation of blood units with the nearest expiry date.  

## Key Features  
- **Blockchain-Based Tracking**:  
  - Tracks blood units through collection, testing, storage, and distribution.  
  - Ensures transparency and immutability of records.  

- **Online Blood Booking**:  
  - Users can book required blood units based on blood group.  
  - Prioritizes blood units with the nearest expiry date to minimize wastage.  

- **Smart Contracts**:  
  - Built using **Solidity** to manage blood inventory, donor details, and transactions.  
  - Deployed and tested on **Ganache** and **Görli** test networks.  

- **Frontend**:  
  - Developed a user-friendly interface using **JavaScript**.  

## Tools and Technologies  
- **Frontend**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS  
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity  
- **Blockchain Testing**: Ganache, Görli testnet  
- **Development Framework**: Truffle  


## Highlights
